## Introduction

This website is ... for ...

### Website goals
- Help

### First time user goals
- Think about

### Returning user goals

# UX and UI - (user experience and user interface)


### Mobile first approach
All pages are designed to be responsive to different screen sizes to accommodate users with different preferred devices.

### Accessibility

Semantic HTML is used to aid people with dissabilities such as visual impairment and alternative text is used for all images so it can be read by screen readers. Semantic HTML also helps with search engine optimization so the right users can find this site and find it useful.

## Agile software development


Scrum, using both incremental and iterative development, was chosen as the main Agile methodology to use in this project. Planning workload into iterations, also known as sprints, with a mindset of "continuous improvement". For each iteration, a kanban board was used to visualize the current workload. Between iterations, remaining workload in the product backlog was reviewed and next iteration was planned.

All features that could possibly be implemented were added as [issues on GitHub.](https://github.com/NiclO1337/pp4-banana-palace/issues) <br>(*Hold Ctrl (or Cmd) and click to open in a new window.*)



### Epics

Project was broken down into different epics, large bodies of work, with features that might be included in the project. Each epic in turn is broken into smaller user stories where each user story provides a value to a specified user. User stories were created from both restaurant owner and users of the website.

### User stories

All user stories are added as [issues](https://github.com/NiclO1337/pp4-banana-palace/issues) on GitHub. They consist of what value they brings, which acceptence criteria is required for it to be marked as complete and some tasks to complete.

### Kanban board

Github projects was used as a kanban board during development. In each iteration, relevant user stories are moved onto the board and development began. Features were developed to fulfil the acceptence critera's of the user stories.
